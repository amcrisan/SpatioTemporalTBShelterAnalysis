# Abstract
*Setting:*  British Columbia (BC) has a low incidence of tuberculosis (TB), with the burden of endogenously acquired disease concentrated amongst vulnerable populations, including the homeless. In May 2008, a TB outbreak began in a BC homeless shelter, with a single index case seeding multiple secondary cases within the shelter.

*Objective:* To use nightly shelter records to quantify the risk of TB infection amongst shelter users as a function of their sleeping distance from and duration of exposure to the index case.

*Design:* Sleeping location and duration of exposure were visualized and univariable logistic regression on distance and time metrics was performed using infection status as the outcome. Recursive partitioning was used to determine a threshold optimally separating infected and uninfected individuals.

*Results:* Of 161 exposed shelter clients, 58 had a recorded outcome of infected (n=39) or non-infected (n=19). Only duration of exposure to the index was associated with increased risk of infection (OR=1.26); stays of five or more nights put shelter clients at higher risk of infection (OR=4.97). 

*Conclusion:*  In the shelter environment, long-term clients are at highest risk of TB infection and should be prioritized for screening during an outbreak investigation.
